# Premier-League-Live-Data-Analytics-with-Python-MySQL

This project focuses on fetching live English Premier League data from a REST API, processing it using Python, and storing it in a MySQL database for structured analysis. The objective is to create a scalable pipeline that bridges real-time sports data with analytics-ready storage, enabling dynamic exploration of team performance, standings, and trends.

**Key Features**

* Real-time extraction of English Premier League match and team data via API.

* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with Python for seamless data handling.

* Structured storage in MySQL for long-term accessibility and advanced querying.

* Analytical foundation for generating insights into rankings, wins/losses, and goal performance.

* Modular design to easily adapt for other leagues or datasets.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

* Python (data fetching, transformation, and pipeline automation)

* MySQL (relational storage and structured querying)

* REST API (live Premier League data source)

* Jupyter Notebook (development, experimentation, and documentation)
